* [Flutter Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqHOtlh3Dd4)
* Leanred about command prompt where I put flutter into a new folder to put into vscode.
* In vscode I need to open a folder and select the folder that I stored the informations in. For me it is called Flutter Project --> classico.

* Learning about extentions in vscode.
  * material icon theme
  * dart
  * awesome flutter snippets
These tools helps us make our codes much quicker than before. It autofills the code that we want and we just have to change the name of these codes.
* I also learned that in order to make the preview of my app to look like it is on the phone I need to download Android SDK
  * Android SDk (makes the preview look like a phone instead of a website)
