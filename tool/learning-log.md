10/25/23:

* [Flutter Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqHOtlh3Dd4)
* Leanred about command prompt where I put flutter into a new folder to put into vscode.
* In vscode I need to open a folder and select the folder that I stored the informations in. For me it is called Flutter Project --> classico. 

11/25/23:
* Learning about extentions in vscode.
  * material icon theme
  * dart
  * awesome flutter snippets
These tools helps us make our codes much quicker than before. It autofills the code that we want and we just have to change the name of these codes.
* I also learned that in order to make the preview of my app to look like it is on the phone I need to download Android SDK 
  * Android SDk (makes the preview look like a phone instead of a website)

12/10/23:
* I learned about the documentation online by watching tutorials.
  * making boxes that contain information.
  * changing the color to the one I want.
  * using fonts to make the text look more unique.

12/17/23:
* I learned that flutter have the same concept as making a website.
  * The font can be changed to our liking.
  * It is able to make logos and symbols such as the next button.

2/11/24:
* I learned that Flutter has a lot of documentation.
  * different types of keywords for different types of icons.
  * there are different sections such as the head, body, and bottom.

3/3/24:
* I learned that Flutter has a built-in system where we have code shortcuts to quickly implement the functions we are looking for.
* I also learned flutter has different categories and each part is built into each other to complete something as a whole.

3/10/24:
* I figured out that my app needs API.
  * Application programming interface that allows datas to be stored and transfered. (This can help me make things like the login page and the job post).
* I also learned that firebase is recommendated.
  * It has realtime database allowing users to store large amount of datas.
  * It also allow texting functions (not going to be in my MVP but good to know).
* Going to try unzipping some API and see what it does and use the ones that are helpful.

3/17/24
* I learned more about API
  * Post, get, update, and delete have their respective APIs.
* I learned that I didn't need to unzip any API.
  * I just need to edit pubspec.yaml file in my Flutter library for the APIs.
* Firebase (maybe will do it if I have time still keeping a mental note of it).
* Trying to organize my app to have sections with user assessability.

3/31/24
* I learned created a login in design page.
  * trying to use firebase to make it so that it can store data.
* Problem (i accidentally cleaned my flutter files)
  * multiple errors
    * trying to fix it by redownloading flutter and copy and paste the code I have already.

4/7/24
* I fixed 506,016 errors. How?
  * I reinstalled Flutter
    * Downloaded android embulator
      * The phone model is know visible
* Created the login page.
  * Functionality is not completed (firebased needed)
    * Next step: making the login linked into the next section of the app the main page.
