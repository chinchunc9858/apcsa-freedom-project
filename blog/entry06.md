# Entry 6
## 6/2/24

My current stage in the Engineering Design Process (EDP) is communication because I have completed my prototype and presented my project. When I was working on my prototype, I was able to understand the value of embarrassment from failure. I wanted to use the tool Firebase for my Flutter App, but I spent so much time learning Firebase and when I started to use Firebase it said that I failed to initialize Firebase correctly. I wasn't able to solve the issue due to the time I had left so I decided to scratch the idea of Firebase and stayed positive telling myself that the videos IU have watched are part of my knowledge so next time if I know how to initialize it then I would be able to do what I want.

### Content

**1. Expo Presentation Takeaways** <br>
- I learned that even though the presentation was informal, it helped me understand the importance of reviewing the project. I realized there are things I could have improved such as skipping through the MVP/BMVP videos. The time for the audience to watch that video takes away a lot of time, so I learned to skip around to the main functionalities during the in-class presentation.

**2. In-class Presentation Takeaways** <br>
- I realized that even though I didn't use Firebase in my project I failed to initialize the Firebase correctly. I have spent a great amount of effort in watching and trying to understand the functionality of Firebase and it may seem like it was all in vain but in the future when I figure out how to initialize it then all those videos I have watched will guide me to build my project in the future. In life, we need to see the positive side of things, can't always be negative since our emotions depend on how we view things.

#### Next Step:

I would start a new project that would solve a new problem in our society and start planning out the project step by step by following the Engineering Design Process.

#### Skills: Two skills I developed for this entry.
1. I learned a growth mindset because I faced an obstacle that may seem like it wasted my time but I realized that the amount of time I spent on that topic would still be with me so technically that skill is not wasted. It is just a matter of when will I use that tool again with proper initialization.
2. I learned time management because I realized that the video I had recorded was going to take a long time for the audience to watch one by one so I decided to play both videos at the same time and then skip through my BMVP since my MVP cover most of it.
