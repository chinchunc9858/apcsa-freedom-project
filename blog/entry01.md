# Entry 1

My current stage in the **Engineering Design Process (EDP)** is **defining the problem**. The number of unemployed people is high. With the help of online job applications, apps can greatly reduce the search time for people to find a job that is best for them. My next step would be planning out my tool so that I can use it efficiently. 
### Content
**1. Which tool Iâ€™ve decided on (and why)**
The tool I decided to use is [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) because I want to be an app developer in the future, so I want to start making an app.

[Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) is compatible with Windows unlike [Swift](https://www.swift.org/download/). [Swift](https://www.swift.org/download/) is only compatible with MacBook or renting a digital MacBook costs money. That is also part of the reason why I chose [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

**2. What I'm going to make with it**
The app that I am going to make is based on my [infosys](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H8SfYzTIGUdIyTyMaAfoNEndREPQ05cy/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118116024569649647271&rtpof=true&sd=true) app design. The main goal of the app is to help unemployed people find jobs. The seeker would look for jobs that are being posted by the employers from the app. This would be possible with the helps of [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/), and [Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#:~:text=%20To%20start%20the%20Android%20Emulator%20and%20run,problem%20or%20to%20get%20more%20information.%20See%20More.).

**Skills:** Two skills I developed for this entry.
1. I learned **how to google** by researching my topic and the tools I needed for Flutter to work properly.
2. I learned **how to learn** by following tutorials about setting up Flutter in Command Prompt. This taught me that the Command Prompt is very important for our devices, it is basically a codespace that contains all the files and folders we have on our laptop. I also learned that Swift can not be used for Windows unless I rent a MacBook on Windows.
