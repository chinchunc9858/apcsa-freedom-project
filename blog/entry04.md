My current stage in the Engineering Design Process (EDP) is creating a prototype. I would be making a screen where employers can post jobs for those who are looking for jobs. My next step would still be creating a prototype becasue I have underistamted the amount of time I need to make learn about this tool. The more I look into it the more confused I get.

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) can be used to store datas like a sign up page. (Side note to look back into).
- [APIS](https://reqres.in/) I would use these apis to my advantage to make a job posting page.
