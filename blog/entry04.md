# Entry 4
## 3/17/24

My current stage in the Engineering Design Process (EDP) is creating a prototype. I would be making a screen where employers can post jobs for those who are looking for jobs. My next step would still be creating a prototype because I have underestimated the amount of time I need to learn about this tool. The more I look into it the more confused I get.

### Content

**1. learning new content for the app** <br>

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) can be used to store data like a signup page. (Side note to look back into).
- [APIS](https://reqres.in/) I would use these APIs to my advantage to make a job posting page.

Using the APIs I will be able to create these basic functions, get, post, update, and delete.

Each function has its own job.

I also learned that the `pubspec.yaml` is very important because that is the place where we tell Flutter the type of API and source of codes we are trying to use so that the functionality would work just fine.

#### Next Step:

I would be creating the page and making sections to organize the page such as having settings and a homepage button so it brings the users to the respected area they pressed.

#### Skills: Two skills I developed for this entry.
1. I learned how to google to further my understanding of app development. Realizing other existance that helps with app development like [APIS](https://reqres.in/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
2. I learned how to learn by using APIs and watching videos to clarify the `pubspect.yaml' file in my Flutter library.
